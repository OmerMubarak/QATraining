- Speeds up development lifecycle by allowing developers to commit incremental changes instead of an entire application.

Azure Repos
- Encourages collab and more effective code reviews by offering threaded discussions and continuous integration for every change.

Git
- Uses a unique branching model to allow frictionless context switching, role-based code lines, experimentation, and feature-based workflow.
